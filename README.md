# :house_with_garden: ApARtment Picker

ApARtment Picker is a React Native mobile app for viewing apartments in Augmented Reality. The app was built using ViroReact, a platform for building AR/VR apps in React Native. Users can walk through 3D AR Portals to view 360 degree images of apartments that matched their search criteria.

## :rocket: Motivation

We built ApARtment Picker over three days for our "Stackathon" project at Fullstack Academy of Code.
